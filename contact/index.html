                <h4>CRAFTS FOR CHARITY INC TERMS OF USE</h4>
           <div class="term-of-use-content">
            <p>This Terms of Use Agreement (“Terms of Use”) constitutes a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and Crafts For Charity Inc ("Company," “we," “us," or “our”), concerning your access to and use of the https://craftsforcharity.com website as well as any other Company media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). If you are agreeing to these Terms of Use on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant to us that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms of Use. You agree that by agreeing to these Terms of Use or otherwise accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. 

                Please read these Terms of Use carefully before, as they (among other things) provide in the “Dispute Resolution” section below that you and the Company will arbitrate certain claims instead of going to court and that you will not bring class action claims against the Company. If you do not agree with all of these Terms of Use, then you are expressly prohibited from using the site and you must discontinue immediately.
                
                Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. The Company may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to these Terms of Use (“Changes”) at any time. Changes will be effective: 
            </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Thirty (30) days after the Company provides notice of the Changes, whether such notice is provided through the Site user interface, is sent to the e-mail address associated with your account or otherwise; or </li>
                  <li>When you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of these Terms of Use incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first.</li>
              </ol>
              
                
                The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. 
                
                The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). 
                
                The Site is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Site. If you are a minor (under 13), you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Use on your behalf prior to you using the Site.

                <p>
                   <b style="color:#000000">Agreement to Arbitrate.</b>  This “Dispute Resolution” Section is referred to herein as the “Arbitration Agreement.” The parties agree that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes between you and Company arising out of, relating to, or resulting from these Terms of Use, shall be subject to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement, and not any court action (other than a small claims court action to the extent the claim qualifies).  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Class Action Waiver.</b> The parties agree that each party may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Procedures.</b> Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's (“AAA”) rules and procedures (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions below. You may visit http://www.adr.org for information on the AAA and http://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a claim against the Company. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Venue.</b> The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Company may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on each party, but subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Governing Law.</b> The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the state of Maryland, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Site users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Costs of Arbitration.</b> Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees“) will be governed by the AAA's Rules.  Each party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Confidentiality.</b> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties. 
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#000000">Severability.</b> If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than the Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of the Class Action Waiver are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of Terms of Use continue to apply.

                    Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall the Company or its affiliates, contractors, employees, officers, directors, agents, or third party partners, licensors or service providers, be liable to you for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages that arise out of or relate to the site, including your use thereof, or any other interactions with the company, even if the company or an authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, in which case the company's liability will be limited to the extent permitted by law. In no event shall the total liability of Company or its affiliates, contractors, employees, officers, directors, agents, or third party partners, licensors or service providers to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action arising out of or relating to this agreement or your use of the service exceed one hundred U.S. Dollars.
